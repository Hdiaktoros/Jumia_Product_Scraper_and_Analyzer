# Jumia Product Scraper and Analyzer

This project is a web scraping and data analysis tool designed to extract product information from [Jumia Ghana](https://www.jumia.com.gh). It includes functionality for scraping **Black Friday deals** and **searching for specific products**, with features to visualize and analyze the collected data.

## Features

- **Product Search**: Allows users to search for specific products (e.g., "washing machine") and scrape all available results.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Bar charts showing the top 10 cheapest products.
  - Histograms of product price distribution.
- **Data Export**: Saves the collected data into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Selenium**: For web scraping dynamic content.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python** (Version 3.7 or later)
2. **Microsoft Edge WebDriver**: Ensure it's installed and matches your Edge browser version.
   - [Download Microsoft Edge WebDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)
   - Add the WebDriver to your system's PATH.

## Usage

### 1. Scraping Black Friday Products
To scrape all Black Friday deals:
```python
scrape_black_friday_products()
```
The script will:
- Scrape product details across all pages.
- Sort the data by price (ascending).
- Save the results to `black_friday_sorted_products.csv`.
- Display data visualizations (e.g., bar charts for the cheapest products).

### 2. Searching for Specific Products
To search for specific products (e.g., "washing machine"):
```python
search_products("washing machine")
```
The script will:
- Scrape product details for the search query.
- Sort the data by price (ascending).
- Save the results to `washing_machine_sorted_products.csv`.
- Display data visualizations.

## Data Collected

- **Name**: The product's name.
- **Current Price**: The current price of the product (GHâ‚µ).
- **Initial Price**: The original price before any discounts (GHâ‚µ).
- **Discount**: The percentage discount applied.
- **Reviews**: The number of reviews for the product.
- **Stars**: The product's star rating.
- **URL**: The link to the product page.

## Visualizations

1. **Top 10 Cheapest Products**:
   - A horizontal bar chart showing the cheapest products.
2. **Price Distribution**:
   - A histogram showing the distribution of product prices.

## Example Outputs
